Vi starts in command mode. The positioning commands operate only while vi is in command mode. You switch vi to input mode by entering any one of several vi input com- mands. (See next section.) Once in input mode, any charac- ter you type is taken to be text and is added to the file. You cannot execute any commands until you exit input mode. To exit input mode, press the escape (Esc) key.
